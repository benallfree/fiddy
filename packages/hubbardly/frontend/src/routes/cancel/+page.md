# No Questions Asked Refund and Cancellation Policy

**Effective Date: {formattedDate}**

## Refunds and Cancellations Made Easy!

At **{meta.name}**, we believe in keeping things simple and fun! Whether you need a refund or want to cancel, we’ve got your back with our No Questions Asked Policy. Here’s how it works:

## How It Works

### Requesting a Refund

1. **Reach Out**: Just send us a quick message at help@{meta.domain} saying you’d like a refund. No need to explain why (unless you want to, we love feedback!).
2. **Get Your Money Back**: Once we receive your refund request, our team will process it as quickly as possible. You’ll see the money back in your account within [number] business days, depending on your payment method.
3. **Smile and Move On**: That’s it! No forms, no fuss, no stress. We want you to feel happy and confident working with us, so if something isn’t right, we’ll make it right.

### Canceling a Project Support

1. **Easy Cancellation**: If the project you supported gets canceled, you’ll automatically receive a full refund. No action needed on your part!
2. **Affiliate Commissions**: Even if a project is canceled, any affiliate commissions earned will still be paid. We believe in rewarding your efforts.

## The Fine Print (But Not Too Fine!)

- **Refund Window**: Refunds are available within 10 days of your purchase. If you’re outside this window, give us a shout anyway, and we’ll see what we can do!
- **Affiliate Reversals**: If you request a refund, any associated affiliate commissions will be reversed and considered unearned.

- **Processing Time**: Refunds will be processed back to the original payment method. If that’s not possible, we’ll work with you to find a solution.

- **No Hassle**: Our no-questions-asked policy means exactly that. We trust our customers and want to ensure you have the best experience possible.

## Need Help?

If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may contact us at help@{meta.domain}.
