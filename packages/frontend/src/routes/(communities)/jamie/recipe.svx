**Ingredients:**
- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta, diced
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

**Instructions:**
1. **Cook the Spaghetti**: 
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**:
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and Parmesan cheese until well combined.

3. **Cook the Pancetta**:
   - In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta until it is crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. **Combine**:
   - Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Toss to coat the spaghetti in the rendered fat.
   - Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until the desired consistency is reached.

5. **Season and Serve**:
   - Season with freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste. Garnish with chopped parsley and more Parmesan cheese if desired.
